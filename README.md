# [SAA-C03](https://lralval.github.io/SAA-C03/)

This is my personal wiki where I share notes taken in preparation for the AWS SAA-C03 certification in form of an [online
mkdocs book](https://www.mkdocs.org/) hosted on
[GitHub](https://lralval.github.io/SAA-C03/).

**The wiki is meant to be read [in the web
format](https://lralval.github.io/SAA-C03/).**
