### Serve Control Policies (SCP)
- SCPs are account permissions boundaries
- They don't grant any permissions.
	- SCPS are a way of restricting the actions that can be taken in an AWS account so that all IAM users and roles, and even the root user cannot perform them.
- when an SCP is created
	- it creates a FullAWSAccess policy , so it doesn't restrict anything.   
- [[IAM]] Policies for Account Groups (OUs)
- Affect all users even the root user
- Dont affect service linked policies (like [[S3]] bucket policy)
- use for denies cross account in your org
