# Elastic Load Balancer

## TLDR
AWS family of load balancers. Is used to spread and control traffic to a vertically scaled infrastructre.

## Features
- Server which forwands traffic to other servides (e.g. [[EC2]])
- spread load
- expose single dns access to whole clustered application
- seamlessly handle failures
- health checks
- provides https to instances
- enforce stickyness with cookies
- high availabliy across zones
- separate public traffic from private traffic
- can be setup as **internal (private)**  or **external (public)**
- 

## General
- managed by aws

## Compatible services
- [[EC2]]
- [[EC2]] [[ASG]]
- [[ECS]]
- [[utils/ACM]]
- [[CloudWatch]]
- [[Route53]]
- [[WAF]]
- [[GlobalAccelerator]]

## Health checks
- port and route

## Classic Load Balancer (Deprecated)
- HTTP, HTTPS (layer 7), TCP (layer 4), SSL
- deprecated
- health checks **TCP** or HTTP based
- fixed hostname

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- HTTP, HTTPS, web socket (layer 7)
- need target groups
- can use to target different **containers** on same machine
- good for [[ECS]] and **docker**
- port mapping **feature**
- fixed hostname
- app servers don't see the client IP directly
	- will be forwarded in “x-Forwarded-For” header
	- “X-Forwarded-Port” original Port
	- “X-Forwarded-Proto” original client protocol
- **cannot** attach elastic IP
- **cross AZ** load balancing enabled by **default**
- supports redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS e.g)

### Target groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- [[ECS]] Tasks
- [[Lambda]] functions
- Private IP Addresses

### Routing
- based on path
- based on hostname
- based on query

## Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- **TCP**, TLS, **UDP** (Layer 4)
- high performance, **millions** of **requests** per second
- **less latency**  *100 ms* vs. 400 ms from ALB
- **one static IP per AZ**
- support **elastic IP**
- health checks with **TCP**, **HTTP** or HTTPS
- **cross AZ** load balancing is **disabled by default**

### Target Groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- Private IP Addresses
- Application Load Balancer ([[ELB]])

## Gateway Load Balancer (GLB)
- IP **Protocol** (layer 3, **network**)
- Deploy scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances
	- Examples, Firewalls, Intrusion Detection, Deep Packet Inspection, payload manipulations
- GENEVE Protocol on port 6081

### Functions
- Transparent Network Gateway, single entry exit for all trafic
- Load Balancer distributes to your check machines

### Target Groups
- [[EC2]] Instances
- Private Ips

## Security
- uses [[SecurityGroup]]

## Sticky Session
- by default requests are spread
- can be enabled for [[ELB]] CLB and ALB
- controlled via **cookie** set by the [[ELB]]
- might bring imbalance to the nodes
- duration between 1second to 7 days

### Cookie Types

#### Application based  custom cookie
- generated by the **target**
- can include any custom attributes
- cookie name is set in target group
- dont use AWSALB, AWSSALBAPP or AWSSALBTG, there are reserved for use by ELB

##### Application cookie
- generated by **ELB**
- Cookie name is **AWSALBAPP** 

#### Duration Based Cookies
- generated by ELB
- name **AWSALB** or **AWSELB** for CLB

## Cross AZ Load Balancing
- distributes evenly across all **az** **instances**
- if not enabled distributes evenly across **all az** but not instances
- ALB **always enabled** no extra cost
- NLB & GLB **disabled** by default **cost extra**

## SSL/ TLS
- ELB uses x.509 cert
- SSL allow traffic between clietns and load balancers to be encrypted [[docs/essentials/Encryption 101#Encryption in Transit|in transit]]  (in-flight encryption)
- can use AWS Certificate Manager ([[utils/ACM]])
- can upload own certificates
- required for https listener
- can add multiple to support multiple domains
- can modify securitty policy to support older versions of SSL

### SNI (Server Name Indication)
- clients can use this to specify the hostname they reach
- allows to load multiple certs on one web server https website on one server
- client indicateds hostname of the target server in inital handshake
- only for ALB or NLB or [[AWS CloudFront]]
![[Pasted image 20230522184145.png]]
### CLB
- only one ssl cert
- must use multiple clb if multiple domains via https

### ALB
- multiple listeners with multi ssl certs
- SNI

### NLB
- multiple listeners multi certs
- SNI
- used for routing tcp traffic (e.g. ssh)

## Connection Draining/ Deregistration Delay
- Time to complete in flight request while instance is going to be no longer targeted by ELB
- between 0 and 3600 seconds, default is 300 (5 minutes)
- graceful shutdown period.
- Low value if requests are short.

### Launch Template
- AMI
- Instance Type
- [[EC2]] User Data
-  [[SecurityGroup]]
- SSH Key Pair
- [[IAM]] Roles for the EC2
- Network and Subnets information
- ELB Information 
- min max size
- scaling policies

### [[CloudWatch]] Alarms
- monitor metric and scale out or in

### Scaling Policies

#### Cooldown period
- After scaling no other scaling can be done for a period
- default 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- allows metrics to stabilized
- use AMIs to launch instances faster and use less cooldown period

#### Good Metrics To Check
- CPU Utilization
- Request Count per Target
- Average Network io
- Any custom metric via [[CloudWatch]]

#### Dynamic Scaling

##### Target Tracking
- I want CPU to stay around 50%
- no cooldown period

##### Simple Step Scaling
- when CPU > 70 add 2 && when CPU < 10% remove 2

##### Scheduled Actions
- based on time

#### Predictive Scaling
- Analyze historical load
- ML
- hands of approach
