- Sync Patterns:
	- API Gateway
	- Load Balancers
- Async Patterns
	- SQS
	- Kinesis
	- SNS
	- Lambda triggers (S3)
- Challenges with microservices:
	- repeated overhead for creating each new microservice.
	- Issues with optimizing server density/utilization.
	- Complexity of running multiple versions of multiple microservices simultaneously.
	- Proliferation of client-side code requirements to integrate with many services.
- Some challenges are solved by Serverless patterns:
	- **API Gateway**, **Lambda** scale automatically and you per usage.
	- You can easily clone API, reproduce environments.
	- Generated client SDK through Swagger integration for the API Gateway.
